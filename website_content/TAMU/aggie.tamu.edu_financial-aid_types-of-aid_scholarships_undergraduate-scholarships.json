Howard and Nancy Terry were long-time residents of Houston, where Mr. Terry was successful in a variety of businesses, ranging from banking to oil and gas. In 1986, the Terry family decided to help young people to help themselves by setting up an educational foundation. Mr. Terry had always been grateful for the financial assistance that enabled him to go to college, so they decided to dedicate their time and resources to giving future generations of young people in Texas this same opportunity. Learn more about the Terry Foundation Scholarship Texas Armed Services Scholarship The Texas Armed Services Scholarship (TASSP) has been created to assist promising students from the State of Texas who are committed to education and service.
