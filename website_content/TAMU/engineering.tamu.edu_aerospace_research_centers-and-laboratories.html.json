Lab members (SEAKers) develop intelligent decision support tools to help systems engineers design systems, with a strong emphasis on space mission design. An example is Daphne , the first cognitive assistant to support the design of Earth observing missions. To design intelligent tools like Daphne, SEAKers must become proficient in space system design as well as in various aspects of system design and artificial intelligence (e.g., search and optimization, machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, multi-agent systems, visualization, human-computer interaction). SEAKers also emphasize the rigorous validation of the intelligent agents they develop using experiments, both computational and with human subjects. Finally, SEAKers also like to apply the tools they develop in the design of actual flight projects with new architectures (e.g., NASA TROPICS mission). Faculty supervisor: Daniel Selva Website : https://www.selva-research.com/ Turbulence and Advanced Computations Lab (TACL) The TACL conducts research on fundamental understanding of turbulent flows and turbulent mixing using state-of-the-art simulations at massive scales. While turbulence is the most common state of fluid motion in natural and engineering systems, its complexity has made the topic extraordinarily difficult. At TACL we develop and use the most advanced computational tools on the largest supercomputers available combined with theory and analysis to understand a number of aspects of turbulent flows. Some of the current interest include turbulent simulations at extreme scales, universality of turbulent flows, intermittency and anomalous scaling, turbulence mixing at low and high Schmidt numbers, compressible turbulence, shock-turbulence interactions, and turbulence in thermal non-equilibrium.
