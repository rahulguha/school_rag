Reducing Flow Drag by Crystals Profs. Hussein and Biringen established a new paradigm for passive flow stabilization to delay laminar-to-turbulent transition and reduce skin-friction drag. Their concept is based on extending the phenomenon of wave destructive interferences\u2013traditionally observed only in solids\u2013to the flow field. This novel approach is realized by interfacing the flow with an enlarged and carefully tuned crystal, also known as a phononic"}
