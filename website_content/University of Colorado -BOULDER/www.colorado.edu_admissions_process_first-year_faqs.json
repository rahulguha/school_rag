If this sounds like you, then please share your story. The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience? Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?

As long as you come to CU Boulder the fall after you graduate high school, your summer classes will not make you a transfer student. However, if you take a break before coming to CU (e.g. graduate in spring, take summer classes, and don't come to CU until spring, summer or fall of the next year), you will be reclassified as a transfer student. Do you require transcripts for college work completed while I was in high school? If you apply with the intention of attending CU Boulder directly after you graduate high school, we do not require transcripts for any college work completed while you were in high school in order to review your application for an admission decision. However, if you are admitted, you will be required to submit official transcripts for all college work completed while in high school so we may review the work and, if applicable, award you credit.

International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations, whether leading to a full IB diploma or to an IB certificate, often qualify students for advanced standing at CU Boulder. In general, credit is granted for approved IB examinations at the higher level with a score of four or better. Students admitted to the University of Colorado Boulder, who have graduated from high school having successfully completed an IB Diploma program, shall be granted 24 semester hours of college credit.

Depending on the student’s degree program, some of the 24 credits may not be applicable towards degree requirements. No CU Boulder tuition will be charged for these credits and the 24 credits will only be granted if the student receives a score of four or better on an examination administered as part of the IB Diploma program. If the student scores less than four on each IB subject test, the credit hours granted shall be reduced accordingly. Official scores must be sent to the admissions office directly from the IB organization.

Why was I admitted to Exploratory Studies when that wasn't what I applied to? Students in Exploratory Studies have demonstrated significant academic achievement and potential. While not directly admissible to the competitive degree program of application, students possess the skills necessary to succeed at CU. Exploratory Studies recognizes there are several pathways to disciplines such as business, engineering or design. Our advisors help students identify the pathway that best matches their goals, whether that be their original program of application or the discovery of a different option. If I am admitted to the Program in Exploratory Studies, would my degree be in Exploratory Studies? No. Students in Exploratory Studies will graduate from one of the seven colleges, schools or programs on the Boulder campus. University Exploration & Advising Center (UEAC) advisors work with first year Exploratory Studies students to develop academic pathways for more than 70 majors and to discover complementary co-curricular experiences that align with their interests. When would I transition out of the Program in Exploratory Studies? Many students transfer to one of the degree-granting academic colleges and schools on campus after their first year or opt to continue with Exploratory Studies through their third semester. What is the criteria to be considered for an automatically awarded scholarship? We are currently updating our criteria for the automatic consideration scholarships. Please check the Office of Financial Aid website for more details. When will I know what AP, IB or college course work has been transferred to CU Boulder? If you are admitted and confirm your intent to enroll, your AP, IB or previous college course work will be evaluated to determine what credits will transfer to CU Boulder and how this will be applied to your degree. This process can take several weeks after you have confirmed your intent to enroll. Why was I waitlisted? We continue to see record number of applications every year. Unfortunately, this results in us having many more qualified applicants than we are able to offer admission at this time. If you would like to accept your waitlist offer, please complete the Waitlist Request Form in your application status page . What can I do to improve my chances of being taken off the waitlist? You should accept your spot on the waitlist in your application status page for best consideration. We will not consider additional transcripts, letters of recommendation, or other items for waitlisted students. How many students were offered a spot on the waitlist and how many students do you typically take from the waitlist? Every year is different, and as we continue to review applications, our waitlist evolves and changes. In previous years, we have admitted as few as zero and as many as the entire waitlist. If you would like to accept your waitlist offer, please complete the Waitlist Request Form in your application status page . Do you rank your waitlist? How can I let you know I am interested in CU Boulder? No, we do not rank our waitlist. We review applicants on our waitlist periodically based on space availability. If you would like to accept your spot on the waitlist, you should complete the Waitlist form in your application status page . This is the best way to indicate you are still interested in CU Boulder. If I respond “yes” to the Waitlist Request Form, when will I know if I have been taken off the waitlist? We will continue to review space availability throughout the spring, up until and even after May 1st. If space becomes available at any point, we will notify you via email and your application status page. We will provide all final decisions before July 1. Can I appeal my waitlist decision? No, you are not able to appeal your waitlist decision. If you would like your application to still be in consideration should additional space become available, please complete the Waitlist Request Form to accept your spot on the waitlist. Accepting your spot on the waitlist is the best way to indicate you are still interested in CU Boulder, should space become available. Can I still apply for scholarships and financial aid? Yes, you can still apply for federal financial aid using the FAFSA; you do not need to be admitted to CU Boulder in order to do so. Most scholarships in the CU Boulder scholarship application close on March 15, but some opportunities may still be available. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid with questions. I don't understand my admissions status. Can you explain? Yes! Please view our decisions definitions document that goes into detail about what all of our admissions decisions mean. If you have any further questions please contact your admissions counselor . Why was I admitted to Arts & Sciences Open Option when that wasn't what I applied to? Due to increasing numbers of applications and the overall strength of the applicant pool, some students who did not receive admission into their first-choice major are admitted to Arts & Sciences Open Option. While not directly admissible to the selective degree program of application, students possess the skills necessary to succeed at CU. Students have the option to stay in Arts & Sciences Open Option and explore the 40+ majors offered or may choose any program in the College of Arts & Sciences, select majors in the College of Media, Communication and Information, or the School of Education through their confirmation form in their application status page . How can I transition out of the Arts & Sciences Open Option program? Students who applied to the College of Engineering or the Leeds School of Business and received the alternate major options may choose a new major when you complete the ‘Accept or decline your admission offer form’ located in your application status page . While you may choose to remain in Arts & Sciences - Open Option, students are strongly encouraged to consider a major in either A&S, CMCI, or the School of Education when confirming their enrollment. This ensures progress towards degree requirements from the start of your time at CU Boulder. Once you have chosen a new major and paid your $200 confirmation deposit, you will be directly admitted into your chosen major. Available majors are as follows: College of Arts and Sciences – any major College of Media, Communication & Information – Communication, Information Science, or Media Studies School of Education – Leadership/Community Engagement or Education Studies What if I decide to stay in Arts & Sciences Open Option?

While you may choose to remain in Arts & Sciences - Open Option, students are strongly encouraged to consider a major in either A&S, CMCI, or the School of Education when confirming their enrollment. This ensures progress towards degree requirements from the start of your time at CU Boulder. You will still need to confirm your intent to enroll and pay your $200 confirmation deposit through the confirmation form in your application status page . Background Information - Criminal History What happens if I answer yes to any of the criminal history questions on the application? You will be required to submit the criminal history supplemental form which will be added to your application status page after you submit your application. You will also be required to upload your arrest report or other court documents with this form. Your criminal history information will undergo a specific review separate from the admissions review. Find more information about the Conduct Review process . How far back in my history do I need to report criminal activity? Any stalking, sexual assault and/or domestic violence offense needs to be reported no matter how long ago the incident took place. Any assault, kidnapping, voluntary manslaughter or murder charges within the past 5 years need to be reported. Please be as thorough as possible in your explanation. What kind of offenses do I need to disclose? Applicants who have a pending criminal charge OR who have ever been adjudicated guilty or convicted of assault, kidnapping, voluntary manslaughter or murder within the past 5 years OR who have ever been adjudicated guilty or convicted of stalking, sexual assault and/or domestic violence must disclose this information. How will my criminal history affect my application? Applicants answering ‘yes’ to any of these questions will undergo an additional review by a committee to determine whether the applicant’s offense(s) should have an impact on their admission decision. Factors included in the review process include the nature and gravity of any conduct and whether it bears a direct relationship to a particular aspect of the applicant’s admission, the time passed since the occurrence, the age of the applicant at the time of the conduct and evidence of rehabilitation or good conduct provided by the applicant. For more information please visit our Criminal and/or Disciplinary History Procedures page . How long will it take to review my criminal history? The review process will be completed within a reasonable period of time and may generally take 2-4 weeks following the receipt of all necessary information. This timeline may be extended if additional information is pending from the applicant or third parties such as probations officers, law enforcement agencies, etc. or in other circumstance of good cause as determined by CU Boulder. If the timeline is extended, applicants will be notified of the updated timeline. Is anyone with a criminal history automatically denied admission? No. All applicants who have answered ‘yes’ to the criminal history questions are reviewed on an individual basis. What are my options if my application is denied based on my criminal background? All applicants denied as a result of their criminal history information have the right to appeal this decision. For more information please visit our Criminal and/or Disciplinary History Procedures page . What if I answer ‘no’ even though I have criminal history of the type asked about in the questions? It is required that all applicants disclose their background in the application. If a student is found to have provided inaccurate information on the application, they may be subject to disciplinary action – including revocation of admission and/or dismissal from the university – due to a violation of the Student Code of Conduct. What if this information changes after I have submitted my application? All applicants are required to notify the Office of Admissions if this information changes after they submit their application for admission. You may contact the Office of Admissions at 303-492-6301 to discuss your options. Background Information - Disciplinary History What happens if I answer yes to any of the disciplinary history questions on the application? You will be required to provide an explanation of your disciplinary history in the application for admission. After submitting your application, you may be asked to submit supporting documentation, like a disciplinary report or other documentation from your school. Your disciplinary history will undergo a specific review separate from the admissions review. More information about the Conduct Review process can be found at www.colorado.edu/policies/procedure-applicants-conduct. What information should I include in my explanation? All explanations should include the approximate date(s) of the probation(s)/suspension(s)/expulsion(s), the sanctions issued (e.g., two-day suspension, five-day suspension, expulsion, etc.), and a description of the specific actions that led to the sanctions. Please note that it is important to describe the specific behavior that led to the sanctions. A description such as “I was suspended, because I broke school rules” is not sufficient. Incomplete descriptions will delay the processing of your application. How will my probation/suspension/expulsion impact my application? Applicants answering ‘yes’ to the disciplinary history question will undergo an additional review by a committee to determine whether the applicant’s offense(s) should have an impact on their admission decision. Factors included in the review process include the nature and gravity of any conduct and whether it bears a direct relationship to a particular aspect of the applicant’s admission, the time passed since the occurrence, the age of the applicant at the time of the conduct and evidence of rehabilitation or good conduct provided by the applicant. For more information please visit our Criminal and/or Disciplinary History Procedures page . How long will it take to review my probation/suspension/expulsion? The review process will be completed within a reasonable period of time and may generally take 2-4 weeks following the receipt of all necessary information.

Conduct Information - Post -Admission Conduct Questions I answered conduct questions on my application and I’ve been admitted. Why do I have a new form on my status page with additional questions? Due to recent legislation in the state of Colorado, the conduct review process has been split into pre-admission and post-admission phases in order to allow greater access to education for applicants. The pre-admission questions you answered on the application were specifically targeted to certain offenses, while the post-admission questions are broader and will determine eligibility to participate in campus life. How you answer the post-admission questions will not affect your admission or your ability to enroll at CU Boulder. What will happen if I don’t fill out the form on my status page? Not filling out the form on your status page will prevent a housing assignment from being released and will prevent you from registering for your second semester on campus. It will not prevent you from confirming your intent to enroll, applying for housing or registering for your first semester. COVID-19 Where can I stay up to date on campus updates regarding COVID-19?
