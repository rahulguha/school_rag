That's why we created the following FAQ. Below you will find a General Admission FAQ, International Admission FAQ, and how the Admissions Department can help any questions you may still have after reading the FAQs. General Admission Questions What are your admissions criteria? When evaluating an applicant for admission, Embry-Riddle takes into consideration a student's high school academic record (both courses taken and overall grade-point average), rank in class, and activities. Embry-Riddle values individual academic achievement, initiative, talent and character above standardized testing. Therefore, submission of standardized test scores (SAT or ACT) is optional for admission. If scores are submitted, they will be treated as supplemental information through the evaluation process. If you do not feel that your scores accurately reflect your abilities, you do not need to submit them. Scores will not be used for placement in freshman classes. High school students are advised to prepare for Embry-Riddle by taking three years of math, four years of English, two years of social science, and two years of science with lab. Students should have a background in algebra, geometry, and — for engineering majors — calculus and trigonometry. Chemistry and physics are the preferred science courses. Learn about required course placement examinations When should I apply for admission? High school students may apply at the end of their junior year. Students applying for the fall semester should submit applications by Jan. 15 to be eligible for the maximum amount of aid. It is suggested that students apply at least 60 days before the start of any term to allow ample time for processing. International students will want to refer to the International Admissions page for more on application dates. Can I change my major or my campus? To change degree programs, you must have permission from the department chair of the program you're in and of the program you wish to enter. There also must be space available in the program. The longer you wait to change programs, the more likelihood there is of losing credits. Generally speaking, you may transfer between campuses if there is space available, as long as you do not break continuing student status. Do you accept transfer credits from other colleges? What courses should I take if I plan to transfer to Embry-Riddle at a later date? Students who have earned college credits after graduating from high school and prior to attending Embry-Riddle are transfer students. Transfer credits will be accepted if they meet all of the following criteria: Credits were obtained from an accredited school A grade of C or better was achieved in the course The course description matches the course description of an equivalent course at Embry-Riddle The credits can be applied toward the desired degree program. Official transfer credit evaluation will be done through the Records & Registration Office, upon acceptance. If a student plans to attend another college or university before attending Embry-Riddle, a good guideline to follow is to take general education courses such as math, English, humanities, social, and physical sciences. Do not take courses that are technical in nature. The student should use the Embry-Riddle course catalog as a guide or contact their Admission Counselor for a transfer guide. Students transferring to Embry-Riddle should be in good academic standing with a minimum cumulative grade-point average (GPA) of 2.0 from the last college attended, as well as a combined GPA of 2.0 from all colleges attended in order to be considered for admission. Students wishing to pursue technical majors must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5. If a student has fewer than 30 college credits at the time of application, a high school transcript will be required. For more information on transferring, visit the Transfer Student website . I’m taking AP, IB or A-level exams. Will I receive transfer credit? Advanced standing credit for these exams are awarded if scores meet a specific criteria and the credit satisfies a course requirement of your major or minor course of study. Read more about these credits on our transfer credit page . What are your Admissions office hours? How can I get a tour? The admissions office is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Counseling sessions and campus visits are available. To set up an appointment, call the Daytona Beach campus toll-free at 800-862-2416 or schedule a campus visit online.

The Career Services Office at Embry-Riddle provides assistance to those seeking employment opportunities. This office serves as a resource for students and helps them secure employment in their field of specialization. Examples of functions the Career Services Office performs include counseling, résumé critiques, and arranging on-campus interviews. This office offers seminars on developing job-search skills, such as how to research a company, what questions to ask in an interview, and more. The annual career fair brings industry leaders to campus to recruit Embry-Riddle students and graduates. The Career Services Office administers a web-based job listing and interview database that matches student and alumni job-seekers with openings in the industry. The Career Services Office is also responsible for coordinating the cooperative education program. The co-op program places qualified students in positions with companies while students are still in school. While working, the student receives academic credit as well as valuable on-the-job training. Many co-op students receive a salary, as well. This experience will give students who have done a co-op an \"edge\" over other graduates, and will enhance their resumes. Learn more about the Career Services Office How does ROTC work? Both two-and four-year Air Force, Navy and Army ROTC programs are available. You can participate on a voluntary basis or make a service commitment, in which case you may be eligible for significant scholarship benefits. Even if you don't take ROTC as a freshman, you can still participate in the two-year program, provided you contact our ROTC Office by the end of the fall semester of your sophomore year. At the beginning of your junior year, you must decide whether you wish to sign a contract that obligates you to military service after college. (Keep in mind that you do not know what your military job assignment will be until the end of your junior year.)

Visit the Degrees page for more information What will it cost to attend? Your cost will vary slightly by academic program. Students pursuing a degree program requiring flight training will have additional costs. You will find, though, that Embry-Riddle is by far one of the most affordable private universities for aviation/aerospace education. Keep in mind, just because a private university costs more than a public state university, it doesn't necessarily mean you will pay more out of your pocket. Schools that cost more are authorized to award higher amounts of financial assistance, so your out-of-pocket cost could be the same, or even less. Visit the Estimated Cost page for more information Where do students eat on campus? Eating together with other students can be an important and positive part of the college experience.
