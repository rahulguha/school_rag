Additional Resources Living Expenses Housing and food estimates are based on average costs. All first-year students are required to live on campus for the first two academic years. Transfer students who are 21 years of age or older on or before September 1 of their year of entry to the University are not required to live on campus but may request to live on campus if space is available. Please reference the catalog for the complete housing policy and exemptions. A minimum meal plan is required for students living on campus. The required 757 Express plan provides 14 meals per week and $100 in Sodexo bucks and is $3,503 per semester. Indirect Costs Direct Costs are charges billed to your student account each semester and include tuition, fees, campus housing and dining plan/food. Indirect Costs are an estimate of additional funds needed. You should allow for expenses such as books, supplies, personal hygiene, laundry and transportation. Although these expenses may be covered by financial aid, we do not recommend borrowing for them unless no other funds are available. Net Direct Costs are determined by subtracting your annual financial aid awards from the estimated direct costs. These costs may be covered through external scholarships, a Federal Parent Loan (PLUS), a private loan and/or our payment plan. Mandatory Fees In addition to mandatory fees outlined in the cost of attendance, students may incur other fees like parking. All students will be provided and charged for student health insurance. Students with comparable coverage may opt out by submitting the waiver form during the waiver period. The rate for the 2024-2025 academic year is $1,870 per semester. The rate for the 2025-2026 academic year will be posted when available. Read more about the coverage and how to waive out on the Health Services website . Flight Student Estimated Cost Embry-Riddle's flight program is designed to allow students to earn their ratings in three years (unlike many other schools). Embry-Riddle also lobbied Congress to allow its students to receive a restricted ATP with 500 less hours than the FAA mandated 1,500 hours, allowing our students to be years ahead of others in their career field. Students pay after each flight activity, and costs vary by student ability, flight ratings being pursued and other factors. Flight training takes place in state-of-the-art aircraft — Cessna 172s, and Diamond DA42s — with Garmin G1000 glass cockpits and ADS-B real-time radar. How much will it cost to fly? Please take into consideration that prices will vary per student since no two students learn at the same rate.
