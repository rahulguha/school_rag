    "ai": "Based on the contextual information provided from the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University website, here is a summary of the key points about the cost of attending ERAU:\n\n1. The costs and tuition presented are \"an estimate and may not reflect all costs and expenses incurred while attending your respective campus.\" The actual costs can vary.\n\n2. Embry-Riddle \"reserves the right to increase or modify tuition and fees without prior notice, upon approval by the Board or as otherwise consistent with Board policy and to make such modifications applicable to students enrolled at the respective campuses.\"\n\n3. The website provides information about tuition and estimated costs, but does not list specific dollar amounts. It indicates these costs can be found in \"other University publications or webpages.\"\n\n4. The website encourages prospective students to review the \"Tuition and Estimated Costs\" page for the most up-to-date information on the expenses associated with attending Embry-Riddle.\n\nSo in summary, the contextual information does not provide definitive cost figures, but indicates that tuition and fees at Embry-Riddle are subject to change and that students should refer to the university's published materials for the latest estimated costs. The website emphasizes the need to check the official Tuition and Estimated Costs page for the most accurate and current information.\n\nSource URLs: \nhttps://daytonabeach.erau.edu/admissions/estimated-costs\nhttps://daytonabeach.erau.edu/\nhttps://daytonabeach.erau.edu/admissions/faq"
